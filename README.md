High Precision Laser Control by Stepper Encoder Motor Position and Speed Control

I used 2 stepper motors, motor driver, breadboard to see output of stepper motor on oscilloscope, power supply and Arduino. After wiring necessary connections, I could control speed of motor in microseconds domain and position of the motor. Normally this step motorâ€™s 1.7 degree equals to 1 step. However, I could spin smaller steps by using this driver since we can adjust resolution. I provided serial communication between Qt framework and Arduino, also I designed 2 different interfaces on Qt which are laser control system by camera and laser control system by coordinate. First, I used mousePressEvent function to get x and y axis value from widget and send these values to Arduino and this application provides that we can send laser to all points in certain area. Secondly, I designed a new Windows desktop application that sending 2 lasers to at the same point while we know only location of lasers and target object. First, I designed a dynamic interface. Then, I focus on a math calculation which provides us which angles between laser and target object and I created algorithm according to some math calculation and I set a coordinate syste Finally, test results were as we expected and satisfying for both applications as you can see in videos that are in the repository.
